I'm using **TMUX** and **VIM** as IDE for Javascript.

For VIM I used this plugin collection:  
http://vim.spf13.com/

This has awesome plugins like Bundle, PowerLine, NerdTree and ControlP.  

For TMUX I used this configuration:  

https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux  

thiss has a lot of plugins for mouse mode, powerline and more.
I'm using Tmuxp too for load my tmux sessions: https://tmuxp.git-pull.com/en/latest/
